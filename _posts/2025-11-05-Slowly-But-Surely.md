Finding something to help with can be harder then ever before because of the large amounts of repositories to help join if you don't have a project you want to start yourself. Luckily I found out about a project called **Bazzit** which in turn also has **Bluefin** and **Aurora**. These projects help take **Fedora Atomic** desktop and make them special for certain user groups like gamers or developers.

* [Bluefin (GNOME)](https://projectbluefin.io/)
* [Aurora (KDE)](https://getaurora.dev/en)

These projects made me excited again about the Linux community but also a way to possibly help out in some way into one of these projects. Before I started to jump in and start fixing things, I found the project group that hosted these projects and just watched/researched what I could about the way these things all talked to each other. I would find an issue on a repo that sounded interesting and would try and figure out more about how it all worked. I might not solve the issue but I would understand the architecture of the project and hopefully feel comfortable with actually fixing those issues in the future. During this time, I did **veer** away from this project from time-to-time like a cat finding a laser pointer on the wall. I was looking into one issue and jumped into a rabbit hole of a mess trying to figure it out which caused some frustration on my part but I did learn a bit more doing then just **giving up** like I've done in the past. Stop working on something without a solution is hard for me to do but I'm happier for it. After feeling a bit more time watching and learning, I found an issue on **Bluefin** that had an issue using the package manager named **Bazaar** just breaking and failing when just opening it. I found this as an way to just grab some logs and help out with the issue. I couldn't **solve** the issue but wanted to help. I found out some way to grab logs for flatpaks and was able to grab the logs after the application failed and was able to post those into the issue to allow others to see if they can solve that issue. Success! What I provided seemed to help and I was happier and smarter because of it. I couldn't ask for anything more and what a way to increase my confidence. Since then, I was able to find some issues that needed someone to help with and was able to update those issues with some ideas and place some pull requests into the project with them being **merged** into the project. To me, this makes my day. Having the ability to help out others and be a part of the solution to me is amazing.

After doing this on my own, an awesome video came out from Youtuber and programmer named **ThePrimeTime** in which he had a collection of people from the OpenSource community and they talked about how to contribute to opensource the right way and what **not to do**. I would highly recommend watching it:
