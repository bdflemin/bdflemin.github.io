I've finally found some time to just write down some thoughts using this `Github Jekyll` setup for my own amusement. A way to collect my thoughts on technology that interest or confuse me. A place to write it down to make sure I can come back to it and ponder some more at a later date. I really don't know what this place is or what it will become but I'm doing this for me. The **fear** of failing has stopped me a lot during my whole adulthood that I need to find ways to combate it.
